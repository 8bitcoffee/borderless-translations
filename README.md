### Description
<!-- Description goes here -->
<p dir="auto">
This site provides a central portal where contractors and administrators can share project information. It enables contractors the opportunity to quickly communicate the status of their projects and allows administrators the ability to assess and assign translators at a faster pace. Reducing downtime and inefficiencies in getting projects up, out and completed. 
This site also allows contractors to keep track of their projects and log their progress in order 
to coordinate assignments with Borderless Translations as well as their fellow translators and proofreaders.
